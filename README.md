# RealGraphGPUplusplus
## Experiments

In this section, we validate the effectiveness of RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> by answering the following evaluation questions (EQs):

* EQ1<sup>[\[1\]]()</sup>: How much does RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> improve the original RealGraphGPU in terms of the IO time and IO-BW?
* EQ2<sup>[\[2\]]()</sup>: How much does RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> provide better performance than RealGraphGPU?
* EQ3<sup>[\[3\]]()</sup>: Does RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> provide the performance better than state-of-the-art single-machine-based engines?
* EQ4<sup>[\[4\]]()</sup>: Does RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> provide the performance better than state-of-the-art distributed-system-based engines?
