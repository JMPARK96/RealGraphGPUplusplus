# RealGraphGPUplusplus
  # Experiments

In this section, we validate the effectiveness of RealGraph+ by answering the following evaluation questions (EQs):

EQ11: Are our optimization strategies effective in improving the performance of RealGraph+?
EQ21: How much does RealGraph+ improve the original RealGraph in terms of the IO-BW/exec. time in graph processing?
EQ32: Does RealGraph+ provide the performance better than state-of-the-art single-machine-based graph engines?
EQ43: Does RealGraph+ provide the performance better than state-of-the-art distributed-system-based graph engines?
