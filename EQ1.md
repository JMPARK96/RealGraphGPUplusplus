# EQ1. IO improvement of RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup>

We show the superiority of RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> to RealGraph<sup>GPU</sup> in terms of IO time and IO-BW. We performed the experiments on the R750 system with a single NVMe SSD and dual NVMe SSDs (RAID-0), each of which provides the maximum IO-BW of 7GB/s and 14GB/s, respetively. Figure 4 shows the results of measuring the IO time required to transfer graph data from storage to DM using RealGraph<sup>GPU</sup> and RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup>. The IO time of RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> is reduced by 40% and 63% compared to that of RealGraph<sup>GPU</sup> on a single NVMe SSD and the RAID-0 configuration, respectively. This reduction is because the direct storage-to-DM IO in RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> eliminates the extra data copies in the original RealGraph<sup>GPU</sup>. In the case of RAID-0 configuration, the time to load blocks from storage is reduced to half because its IO-BW becomes doubled compared to a single NVMe SSD. 

Figure 5 shows the results of measuring the IO-BW when performing a PageRank in RealGraph<sup>GPU</sup> and RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup>. We see that RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> provides 1.5 and 3.2 times higher IO-BW than RealGraph GPU on single NVMe SSD and RAID-0 configuration, respectively, nearly fully utilizing the IO-BW provided by storage. This is because the block processing cycles of RealGraph GPU+ are pipelined thanks to the asynchronous processing of CPU threads (as mentioned in Section 3.2), producing more-frequent storage-to-DM IOs in storage.
