# EQ3. Comparison with single-machine-based graph engines

We compare RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> with 5 state-of-the-art single-machine-based graph engines: `GraphChi`[^Kyr12], `X-Stream`[^Roy13], `TurboGraph`[^Han13], `GridGraph`[^Zhu15], and `FlashGraph`[^Zhe15]. We ran BFS, PR, and WCC, which are commonly provided by all graph engines, on the PC, which is because the code for 5 competitors is executable only on the PC. Note that RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> was unable to run in the PC system because the its GPU does not support direct storage-to-DM IO. We thus estimate the execution time of RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> in the PC system as the execution time of RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> in the R750 system x (the ratio of the execution time of RealGraph<sup>GPU</sup> in the PC system compared to that of RealGraph<sup>GPU</sup> in the R750 system). Figure 9 shows the execution times of RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> and existing single-machine-based graph engines, where "O.O.M" and "O.O.T" denote the results of out-of-memory and out-of-time (i.e., exceeding 24 hours). We note that TurboGraph does not perform WCC on the Wiki and UK datasets (i.e., infeasible). We observe that RealGraph GPU++ provides performance dramatically better than existing graph engines, by up to 114Ã— better than TurboGraph which is the best performer among competitors. This is because RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> substantially improves its IO processing while maintaining the excellent workload balancing capability of RealGraph and the outstanding GPU processing capability of RealGraph<sup>GPU</sup>.
