# EQ3. Comparison with single-machine-based graph engines

We compare RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> with 5 state-of-the-art single-machinebased graph engines [4–6, 10, 11]. We ran all algorithms and all datasets with all graph engines on the PC, which is because the code for 5 competitors is executable only on the PC [8]. Figure 8 shows the execution times of RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> and existing single-machine-based graph engines, where "O.O.M" and "O.O.T" denote the results of out-of-memory and out-of-time (i.e., exceeding 24 hours). We observe that RealGraph GPU++ provides performance dramatically better than existing graph engines, by up to 114× better than TurboGraph which is the best performer among competitors. This is because RealGraph<sup>GPU++</sup> substantially improves its IO processing while maintaining the excellent workload balancing capability of RealGraph and the outstanding GPU processing capability of RealGraph<sup>GPU</sup>.
